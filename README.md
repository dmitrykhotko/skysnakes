# Sky Snakes

It's a simple game for 2 people.

A while ago I've been completely burnt out as a software engineer and this is my pet that helps me love programming again.

The backend is made on NodeJS + Typescript, the frontend is Typescript + SCSS + HTML.
Almost all code was made on pure ts. I have used several libraries just for styling and scripting.

Thanks for the attention!
